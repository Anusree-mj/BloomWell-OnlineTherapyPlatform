        have different approaches and areas of focus, so it's important to find the right person who 
        can achieve the best results for you. We have found that we are able to provide a successful 
        match most of the time; however, if you start the process and you feel your therapist isn't a 
        good fit for you, you may elect to be matched to a different therapist.`
